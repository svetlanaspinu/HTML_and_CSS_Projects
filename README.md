Projects:
  1. Space Station Website - This one-page website is an website example for a Space Travel company. I have used HYML and CSS to create a navbar, image container, background color and a form.
  2. Academy Cinema Website - This page is an example home page for a Movie Theater that is styled using Bootstrap. It contains many bootstrap components that helps me to create the navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, badges and dropdowns.
